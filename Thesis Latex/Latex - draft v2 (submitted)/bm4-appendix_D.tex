\section{Proof of Outage Probability for the Outage Event $\mathcal{O}$ at an Arbitrary Receiver} \label{HBD_multi_UAV_lemma_P_out_proof}
From \cite[eq. (6)]{ernest2019outage}, the conditional outage probability $Pr\big(\mathcal{O}|d_i, d_j\big)$ at receiver $i$ is: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{eqnarray} 
Pr\big(\mathcal{O}|d_i, d_j\big) \approx \sum_{q=0}^{K_{tr}} \sum_{l_1+\ldots+l_{N-i+1}=q+1} \hspace{-0.2cm} \alpha\big(q,\overline{P}_i d_i^{-n},K_{i},\gamma\big) \binom{l_1 + \ldots + l_{N-i+1}}{l_1,\ldots, l_{N-i+1}} \prod_{j=1}^{N-i} E\Big\{\big(X_{j}d_j^{-n}\big)^{l_j}\Big\}_.
\end{eqnarray}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Thereafter, averaging $Pr\big(\mathcal{O}|d_i, d_j\big)$ over the respective distributions of $d_i$ and $d_j$ yields Lemma \ref{HBD_multi_UAV_lemma_P_out}. This completes the proof.
